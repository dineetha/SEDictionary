Of course there are lots of these Sinhala English Dictionaries :blush: A few Chrome extensions too. Yet this one is written from the scratch. The code is very simple and easy to understand for beginners who are learning JavaScript and JQuery. Current version is only for educational purpose. New features will be added soon. Hope you will contribute to this. Thank you :blush:

New Update :smiley:
A new dictionary file is created with more than 130,000 English to Sinhala one to one definitions combining old dictionary files circulating in the web such as files used in other extensions and android apps.  Also the JSON  file loading method has been changed. Now JSON  file is fetched and stored in Chrome storage when first installation of the extension. The respond time is better now but fast and efficient search algorithm should be implemented. Most dictionary extensions in web store use WebSQL to store words since still Chrome supports it. But I am looking for a solutions with IndexedDB since WebSQL is deprecated. You can suggest new ideas.
